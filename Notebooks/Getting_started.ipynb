    "A **datalab** is a purpose-built software application that runs on ESA Datalabs. From the user's perspective, it functions similarly to a virtual machine, allowing users to launch, use, and delete it as needed. For more information on the functionalities of the datalab implementation, please read [here](https://datalabs.esa.int/help/Datalabs.html). The **Euclid-Q1 datalab** is based on JupyterLab. For basics on JupyterLab, you can access here the [JupyterLab documentation](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of the **Euclid-Q1 datalab** is to provide direct access to the Euclid Q1 data and Euclid Early Release Observations (EROs), *without* the need to download the data. The Euclid data is accessible through the **data** folder on the left-hand side.  This datalab is built for analysis and we strongly encourage you *not to download* Euclid data via the datalab. User-derived data can be, however, downloaded. For downloading Euclid data, please use the [Euclid Science Archive](https://eas.esac.esa.int/sas/). Information about the Euclid Data is available at:\n",

If you're not part of a team already, one can request the set up of a team workspace through the [Euclid Helpdesk](https://support.cosmos.esa.int/situ-service-desk/servicedesk/customer/portal/14) (see Help section below). **Note**: everything you modify in the team workspace is visible to other people that have access to the same workspace. \n",

    "## 2. The Euclid-Q1 datalab\n",

    "### Installed packages\n",
    "\n",
    "This datalab contains a Jupyter kernel called **EUCLID-TOOLS** (conda environment) which includes the following packages:`Astroquery` `Astropy` `Fitsio` `Jdaviz`  `Matplotlib` `Numpy` `Pandas` `Photutils` `Pyarrow` `PyESASky` `Seaborn` `SEP` `Scipy` `Astromatic-scamp` `Astromatic-swarp` `Astromatic-source-extractor`. There is also a version of `Astrometry.net` installed that you can use by calling `/usr/local/astrometry/bin/solve-field path/to/img.fits` in the terminal or `! solve-field path/to/img.fits` in a notebook. \n",
    "\n",
    "For the full list: run `%conda list` in a separate cell in a Jupyter Notebook with the **EUCLID-TOOLS** kernel activated. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Installing new packages**: To install additional packages, use the terminal or Jupyter Notebook. However, if you delete the current Datalab instance and launch a new one, you will need to reinstall any packages you previously added. The best solution is to create a [conda environment](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html) file that can be loaded each time you launch a new datalab instance. For more information about installing packages see guide [here](https://datalabs.esa.int/help/Getting_started_with_Jupyter_datalabs.html). Environment files can be shared with collaborators on team workspaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: ensure you set the **EUCLID-TOOLS** kernel at the top-right hand side of the notebook in order to make use of the pre-installed packages in the kernel.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Resources\n",
    "A user can run **two datalabs** simultaneously. For launching more datalabs, one needs to delete a running instance. When running the Euclid-Q1 datalab you have access to **32 GB RAM** and **2 CPU cores**. My workspace has a total personal storage space of **100 GB**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Monitor usage**: For general usage in Datalabs click **User Icon → My Account → Datalabs Tab**. Additionally, the current total **memory usage** of all kernels and terminals is shown at the bottom left of the Jupyterlab and is refreshed every 5 seconds. It is also possible to type `diagnose` in a terminal to get a more in-depth analysis.\n"

    "### About Euclid\n",
    "Euclid is a European mission, built and operated by ESA, with contributions from NASA. The Euclid Consortium - consisting of more than 2000 scientists from 300 institutes in 15 European countries, the US, Canada and Japan – was responsible for providing the scientific instruments and will provide the scientific data analysis. ESA selected Thales Alenia Space as prime contractor for the construction of the satellite and its service module, with Airbus Defence and Space chosen to develop the payload module, including the telescope. NASA provided the detectors of the Near-Infrared Spectrometer and Photometer, NISP. Euclid is a medium-class mission in ESA's Cosmic Vision programme. You can find more information about the Euclid Mission [here](https://www.cosmos.esa.int/web/euclid).\n",
